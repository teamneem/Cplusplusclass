  Function "main" will repeatedly prompt the user to enter the two meter
  readings for a given customer, as well as that customer's code (see below).
  It will then process that customer information and display the results.  It
  will halt when the user enters "end-of-file" (control-d) instead of a meter
  reading.

  4) Function "usage" will be declared as:

    double usage( int, int );

  where the first argument represents the beginning meter reading and the
  second argument represents the ending meter reading (assume that the meter
  is read by a representative of the utility company at the beginning and
  ending of the billing period).  The readings are taken from a meter which
  has six digits and records tenths of a KiloWatt-Hour (KWH).

  Function "usage" will return the KiloWatt-Hours of electricity used by the
  customer during the current billing period.

  Note that the meter's dial has six digits and records tenths of a KWH.  For
  example, assuming that the beginning reading was 220015 and the ending
  reading was 220039, then the customer used 2.4 KiloWatt-Hours of electricity
  during the billing period.

  Also, note that the reading at the end of the billing period may be less
  than the reading at the start of the billing period, since the meter's dial
  has only six digits.  For example, assuming that the beginning reading was
  999997 and the ending reading was 000005, then the customer used 0.8
  KiloWatt-Hours of electricity during the billing period.



  5) Function "bill" will be declared as:

    double bill( char, double );

  where the first argument represents the classification of the customer ('P',
  'A', 'F', or 'C'), and the second argument represents the KiloWatt-Hours of
  electricity used by the customer during the current billing period.

  Function "bill" will return the amount of money that the customer will be
  billed, based on the customer's code and electricity usage, using the 
  following information.

    Code 'P' (primary residence):

      $0.07 per KWH for the first 300 KiloWatt-Hours, $0.08 per KWH for the
      next 300 KiloWatt-Hours, and $0.09 per KWH after that.

    Code 'A' (alternate residence):

      $0.07 per KWH for the first 200 KiloWatt-Hours, $0.08 per KWH for the
      next 200 KiloWatt-Hours, and $0.09 per KWH after that.

    Code 'F' (farm):

      $10.00 plus $0.07 per KWH.
      
    Code 'C' (commercial):

      $700.00 for 10000 KiloWatt-Hours or less, and $0.09 for each additional
      KiloWatt-Hour used.

  Function "bill" will return a value of zero for an unrecognized customer
  code.
